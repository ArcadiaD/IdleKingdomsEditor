## Idle Kingdoms Editor

A simple route editor for Idle Kingdom Clicker.

This editor is **windows only**

v0.4.8.1
======

With this update shrines have a chance to move 1 space. Grass has a chance to turn to forest and vice versa. So the routing is largely the same, depending on luck a given route could change in your favour or might work against you.

I will update the editor so you can easily edit the underlying map

### Usage 

Download, unzip, run IdleKingdomsEditor.exe

### Controls

* **\+** adds a new route the the list of managed routes, using current width, height, selected tiles and the given name.
* **\-** removes the currently selected route from the list of managed routes
* **Save** saves the managed routes to disk
* **Clear** clears all nodes from the current route
